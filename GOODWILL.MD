## Acknowledgment of Signal and Inspiration

FT-DFRP was conceived, designed, and implemented by **Michael A. Doran Jr.** as a resilient routing substrate for post-cloud, cognition-aware p2p/mesh networks. This work emerged rapidly but not in isolation.

The following individuals are acknowledged as **signal contributors**, **catalysts**, and **recognized inspirations** whose published ideas, open conversations, or epistemic presence helped shape the mental and structural foundation of FT-DFRP.

None of the following parties have seen or contributed to this codebase directly. Their names are offered here in honor and recognition—not to assign legal ownership, but to affirm lineage.

## 🧬 Named Signal Contributors

### 🔹 Adam Firestone (SIX3RO)
For his vision around resilient architecture, trustless infrastructure, and defense-domain integrity design. His insights planted core elements in FT-DFRP’s fault-tolerant, local-first framing.

### 🔹 Ken Granville (MindAptiv)
For deeply original thinking on perceptual computing, semantic data compression, and meaningful proximity. His published philosophies inspired the ANN-vector engine and cognitive routing layers.

### 🔹 Rhett Sampson (GT Systems, Australia)
For critical influence on edge intelligence, adaptive routing models, and symbolic parity. His mental models contributed to the Williams-inspired recovery layer and the ANN-density hybrid scoring.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

In a world dominated by extractive systems and erasure, this mesh routes through memory.

FT-DFRP affirms that **inspiration is real**.  
That **credit can be deep and layered**.  
That builders can **give thanks without ceding rights**.

This document is not required by any license. It exists because gratitude, like trust, is foundational infrastructure.
